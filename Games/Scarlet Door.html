//It couldn&#39;t have been this close before, did it move?// 

From the inside, he could see a gust of wind blowing out, rocking the door open and then immediately closing it. 

//Come here... come here...// 

The invitation to a dance with death herself. As he took step by step he began to be frenzied by the swarm of emotions that filled his stomach. He rushed forward, sprinting towards the door like a lost child. What felt like three steps began to seem like an eternity. At last, he reached the step before the tall, slashed piece of oak. 

[[Slowly... slowly... he opened the door...|Door1]]

<tw-passagedata pid="3" name="3 Doors" tags="" position="499,580">Roy felt a pain in his chest. Unable to hold it in, he knelt down. A vicious torrent of vomit filled the floor. Roy looked down... a look of dread began to fill his face. 

//Why is my vomit red?//

Roy didn&#39;t have time to think- he began puking again, more violently this time. Blood filled the bathroom floor, surrounding the dead body of his beheaded sister.

</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="4" name="A hollow hallway..." tags="" position="822,711">There was a musty smell in the air. The place had not been touched in years... possibly even decades. The walls on the side had begun peeling and sprawling onto the floor, as if trying to reach towards each other. In the front was a glowing open door. It&#39;s properties were certainly estranged- even though inside was shining bright, there was no luminosity whatsoever in the hallway. It was as if the door was sucking in all of the light and life from the empty [[room|comehere]].

The floor was dyed red. Roy looked down at his hand- a knife was dipped in scarlet red, pieces of intestines covering it&#39;s sharp metal blade.

Roy remembered what happened that night. Driven mad from losing his job, he drunkenly rampaged around the house, destroying everything in his path without a second thought. His sister,er  desperate to hold him down, grabbed him from the back. 

&quot;LET ME GO! LET ME FUCKING GO!&quot;

&quot;Stop! Look around you! Don&#39;t hurt me and Mom!&quot; His sister hugged tight around his waist.

&quot;I DON&#39;T CARE! LET ME FUCKING GO!&quot;

Roy grabbed the closest knife around him. His only intention was to cut the clothing his sister was grabbing onto. He spun around, but unable to control his momentum, he made a clean slice into his sister&#39;s [[throat|HA!]].
