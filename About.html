                <h3><b>About</b></h3>
                <p>Hi, We are Restauration. As more and more people decide to eat out instead of cooking at home, restaurants are continuing to grow in size and numbers. As they continue to expand, their vulnerabilities become more and more exposed. Restaurants have been around since the 11th century some historians say, and although foods, equipment and aesthetics have changed, the process of running a restaurant hasn’t. As restaurants continue to gain more patrons, some are looking at expanding staff and floor space to house more patrons and serve them. However this solution doesn’t truly solve the issue, it’s just multiplying the inefficiencies they had since they opened. However we believe our Restaurant Automation Software is the solution for expanding restaurants how want to truly become efficient in the food catering business. We aim to solve problems restaurants have such as table management, communications between table orders and the kitchen, easy archiving of sales, workers recorded hours worked and more through technology. We believe restaurants who are expanding and plan on taking a larger amount of patrons should adopt our Restaurant Automation Software to increase their efficiency, save money and time.
